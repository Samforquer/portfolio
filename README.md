# JS Portfolio Assignment

---

This assignment combines the interpersonal and technical lecture modules. This portfolio page will contain their biographies, stories (Maybe in a blog format), resumes, descriptions of the assignments and assessments they completed, any previous projects they built, and professional images of themselves. The students should develop their own user stories and design the portfolio site themselves. Each student will present their portfolio pages along with their stories and experiences through FastTrack'D to the class.

## Goal

---

Students will create their own portfolio page/site and prepare a presentation in which they will cover their experiences at FastTrack'D, their story which they have developed throughout the course, and their technical abilities by using their portfolio sites to effectively guide and support their presentation. This will serve as a great resource for representing each student individually and their experience throughout the lecture modules of FastTrack'D.

## Wireframe


## Examples
Below is a multi-page portfolio with both desktop and mobile views. The design is very minimal and relies on large areas of white-space.

<!-- ![multi-page](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12191780/161307224-b29bf3e0-e2a6-41c6-bda3-fb90398929f8.png) -->

![home-page](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12191780/161307236-e749eb6d-83af-4ea7-a680-8f49ff5395b9.png)

The landing page for this site includes the about section as well as a download link for the resume and the profile picture.

![work-page](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12191780/161307244-8285e756-3ead-4653-9579-5ea59800093d.png)

Clicking the title of each project will take you to the GitHub repository for the respective project, but you could also include a GitHub icon that links to the project if you prefer.

![contact-page](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12191780/161307252-3646cbb3-5a8e-4d3b-89eb-4ca840786cba.png)

The contact page is very basic and just sends an email to the portfolio owner.


Below is a single scrolling portfolio page with anchors in the navbar leading to different sections on the same page. Click on the image to explore the portfolio's wireframe in Figma.
