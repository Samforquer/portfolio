    <h2>Hi, I'm Sam, a Software Developer</h2>
    <p>
        I was born and raised in Columbus, Ohio. I started a family there, as well as launching my own lawn care
        business.
        I've always been driven by a desire to learn. Whether I was teaching myself chess, golf,
        or how to build my own gaming PCs during my teenage years, I thrived on new challenges.
        My venture into lawn care started as a summer job, but I quickly moved into a management role,
        where I gained valuable leadership, teamwork, and communication skills. I translated what I learned into a
        successful lawn care business of my own,
        yet I longed for a career better aligned with my love for learning new things. So, I dove into software
        development, enrolling in Tech Elevator's 30-week full-stack development
        bootcamp. With over 700 hours of experience and two AWS certificates under my belt, I wanted more. The FastTrack
        program at Cook Systems was the next step, deepening my understanding of Java,
        Sring, JavaScript, and Angular, and gaining more hands-on project experience.
        Today, coding is more than a career path for meâ€”it has become a passion. It's about problem-solving, learning,
        and using technology to make a difference.
        I'm excited to begin a career where I can combine my love for learning,
        technology, and growth and harness them to develop applications that resonate with and enrich people's lives.
